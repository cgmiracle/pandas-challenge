Analysis 

1. After analysis, I have discovered that while a majority of our users are male(84%), there is a delta of $0.18 for average purchase price and $0.40 average purchase per person. This would indicate that an increase in marketing to female potential players, and an increase in female oriented products, would improve the revenue of the the overall game. 
2. Age analysis has showed that our 3 biggest age demographic ranges are 20-24 (44.79%), 15-19 (18.58%), and 25-29(13.37%). The company should invest in marketing to the 20-24 age group through partnerships, such as soda/energy drink companies, chips, and also targeted social media ads. As far as the other age ranges go, further analysis should be done to determine marketing targets.
3. Our popular items and most popular have a corrilation that is obvious. When the time comes that some of these products begin a downward trend, the company should consider offering them at a discount. This will let players who go for cheaper items or do not make purchases, get more popular items. First purchase should be the main target of these promotions, as they may be inclined to spend more and increase playing time when they are more invested.
